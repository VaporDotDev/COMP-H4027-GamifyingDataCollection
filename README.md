## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop a system that utilizes machine learning techniques to perform object detection on Irish vehicles and accurately recognize their license plates. The system aims to collect high-quality data from various sources, such as images, to build a comprehensive dataset. Additionally, gamification techniques are integrated into the system to encourage user participation and improve data collection efficiency.

## Project Objectives

- Implement a deep learning model for object detection of Irish vehicles.
- Develop an algorithm for license plate recognition of Irish vehicles.
- Build a user-friendly web application for data collection and visualization.
- Incorporate gamification elements to motivate users in contributing data.
- Analyze and process collected data for further applications, such as traffic analysis or vehicle classification.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and frameworks were utilized in this project:

- Python
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Flask
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
